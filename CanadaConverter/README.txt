Program was created to read in an input file and convert it to a specific format. The inputs varied from input and expected data. The config file for each 'type' stores in every possible input variable and then handles the creating of the appropriate output data. 

The config file is meticulous and appears to look optimizable. However, given the input files are 'fixed-length' and one parameter/variable is most likely not the same length or size of the next, the substring() method was the best solution.
